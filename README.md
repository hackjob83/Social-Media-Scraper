# Social-Media-Scraper
Twitter and Instagram scraper for images posted with specified hash tag(s)

You will need to update the globals files with your Twitter and Instagram keys (https://apps.twitter.com/ and 
https://instagram.com/developer/register/)

As the directory implies, the scrapers are designed to be run via cron job and / or command line. There is also a script designed
to pull the images that were posted on a regular basis to not slow down the scrape process for high volume keywords.

Some optional features include logging additional hash tags used in Instagram posts, and features tweet responses
(testing page included)
